            "carbon capture and storage (ccs) or carbon capture and sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (co2) before it enters the atmosphere, transporting it, and storing it (carbon sequestration) for centuries or millennia. usually the co2 is captured from large point sources, such as coal-fired power plant, a chemical plant or biomass power plant, and then stored in an underground geological formation. the aim is to prevent the release of co2 from heavy industry with the intent of mitigating the effects of climate change. although co2 has been injected into geological formations for several decades for various purposes, including enhanced oil recovery, the long-term storage of co2 is a relatively new concept. carbon capture and utilization (ccu) and ccs are sometimes discussed collectively as carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (ccus). this is because ccs is a relatively expensive process yielding a product with an intrinsic low value (i.e. co2). hence, carbon capture makes economically more sense when being combined with a utilization process where the cheap co2 can be used to produce high-value chemicals to offset the high costs of capture operations.co2 can be captured directly from an industrial source, such as a cement kiln, using a variety of technologies; including absorption, adsorption, chemical looping, membrane gas separation or gas hydration. as of 2020, about one thousandth of global co2 emissions are captured by ccs. most projects are industrial.storage of the co2 is envisaged either in deep geological formations, or in the form of mineral carbonates. pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (pyccs) is also being researched. geological formations are currently considered the most promising sequestration sites. the us national energy technology laboratory (netl) reported that north america has enough storage capacity for more than 900 years worth of co2 at current production rates. a general problem is that long-term predictions about submarine or underground storage security are very difficult and uncertain, and there is still the risk that some co2 might leak into the atmosphere. opponents point out that many ccs projects have failed to deliver on promised emissions reductions.   additionally, opponents argue that rather than focusing on carbon removal, carbon capture and storage is a justification for indefinite fossil fuel usage disguised as marginal emission reductions. one of the most well-known failures is the futuregen program, partnerships between the us federal government and coal energy production companies which were intended to demonstrate ″clean coal″, but never succeeded in producing any carbon-free electricity from coal.\n",

            "\n",
            "in post combustion capture, the co2 is removed after combustion of the fossil fuel—this is the scheme that would apply to fossil-fuel power plants. co2 is captured from flue gases at power stations or other point sources. the technology is well understood and is currently used in other industrial applications, although at smaller scale than required in a commercial scale station. post combustion capture is most popular in research because fossil fuel power plants can be retrofitted to include ccs technology in this configuration.\n",
            "the technology for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (h2, ch4), and power production. in these cases, the fossil fuel is partially oxidized, for instance in a gasifier. the co from the resulting syngas (co and h2) reacts with added steam (h2o) and is shifted into co2 and h2. the resulting co2 can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. the h2 can be used as fuel; the co2 is removed before combustion. several advantages and disadvantages apply versus post combustion capture. the co2 is removed after combustion, but before the flue gas expands to atmospheric pressure. the capture before expansion, i.e. from pressurized gas, is standard in almost all industrial co2 capture processes, at the same scale as required for power plants.\n",
            "in oxy-fuel combustion the fuel is burned in pure oxygen instead of air. to limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber. the flue gas consists of mainly co2 and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. the result is an almost pure co2 stream. power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as \"zero emission\" cycles, because the co2 stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. a certain fraction of the co2 inevitably end up in the condensed water. to warrant the label \"zero emission\" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately.\n",
